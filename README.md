# cane-toad-image-classifier

Cane toads are becoming increasingly prevalent in NSW, and are often mistaken for a number of native Australian frog species.
The aim of this project is to develop a Convolutional Neural Network that can accurately distinguish between images of cane toads and native frogs.
The model will eventually be deployed as a web application.
